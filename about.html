        <h4>Dr. Tatjana Chircop</h4>
        <h5>Research and Student Academic Management ‚Äì Deputy Principal</h5>
        <p>Dr Tatjana Chircop has been involved in both formal and non-formal education since 1988. At a young age, she became a professional musician with the Manoel Theatre Orchestra and the National Orchestra and taught violin and piano at the Johann Strauss School of Music. After having achieved the FTCL in violin performing and the LTCL in piano performing she also furthered her studies at the Conservatoire National de Region, Lyon.</p>
        <p>Later, she focused on a career in education and fulfilled roles of learning support assistant at St Albert the Great College and a community development worker with Agenzija Appogg, particularly within Valletta Local Council. In 2007 she joined MCAST as a lecturer and later moved into management within the same college, having been appointed Director of the Institute of Community Services, Head of the Foundation College and recently Deputy Principal for Arts and Social Sciences. Dr Chircop is in possession of a BA Hons in English (University of London), a BA Hons in Youth and Community Studies (University of Malta), an MA in Youth and Community Studies (Brunel University), a Master in Intercultural Eco-Management (Universita‚Äô Ca Foscari), a Post-Graduate Certificate in Vocational and Educational and Training (MCAST) and a PhD (Brunel University).</p>
        <p>Dr Chircop carried out research in areas including childlessness, vocational education and performing arts. Her doctoral research combines the gendered nature of identity formation of young women and the music they listen to. The research focuses on how young Maltese women make meaning out of the music they listen to in their everyday lives and how they incorporate this meaning into everyday discourses and identities. Through the research, she explores the consumption of global and local cultural forms of music as leisure and the incorporation or resistance of these cultural forms in identity formation processes. She also analyses ways in which social and cultural capitals are processed in the social and cultural power struggle to form cultural hierarchies.</p>
